# 👋 Hello, I am Jeramie (He/Him)

I’m a youth advocate, artist, and visionary. My curious dedication to wellness + performing arts as well as multiculturalism + public policy fuel my drive to be a catalyst for change as well as progress.

 🌱 I am currently...
* Developing a student-led affinity group and nonprofit around cultural appreciation as well as mental strength.
* Interning to improve Human-Computer Interaction for diverse cognitive styles in Dr. Margaret Burnett's Lab at Oregon State University.

🧑🏻‍💻 Previously, I...
* Awarded $2K from the YEA! Grant. Designed a cultural appreciation curriculum to teach 1.3K+ youth across Benton County through Advisor Presentations, Cultural Toolbox Tuesdays, and Weekly Meetings. Hosted a district-wide Crossroads of Cultures event by partnering with the Benton County Historical Society. Partnered with the Corvallis Multicultural Literacy Center to provide free cultural educational resources like a Global Reference Library & Kits focused on youth-for-youth education for a larger community of 6.8K+.
* Enhanced UI Design by editing, evaluating, and proofreading final copies, resulting in a 14% increase in engagement through the introduction of crossword puzzles and sudoku. Published 10+ articles on various subjects, including Creative Writing Features to Raider Reads. Secured $750 from the YEA! Grant.

🎯 I hope to...
